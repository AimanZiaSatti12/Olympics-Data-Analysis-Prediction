# Olympics-Data-Analysis-Prediction
For this Web Application ,   We have used a historical dataset on the modern Olympic Games,including all the Games from Athens 1896 to Rio 2016. 
          "Identified the most successful countries and athletes in terms of medal count.",
          "Performed deeper analyses on specific countries or athletes to explore their performance over time.",
          "Determined if certain countries or athletes have dominant sports where they excel.",
          "Plotted trends over time, such as the number of participants, gender ratio, or medal distributions.",
          "Visualized the success of countries or athletes based on the number of medals won."
In this Medal Predictor, I have used two Maching Learning algorithms and a Artificial Neural Network (Deep Learning) namely:"
model = ["Random Forest Classifier","Logistic Regression","Neutral Network"]
